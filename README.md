- [ ] curl based installations
- [ ] brew based installtions
- [ ] update preinstalled software (git, vim, etc.)
- [ ] install node & global node packages
- [ ] setup virtual environements
- [ ] download git repos
- [ ] apply settings for apps like iterm & vscode
- [ ] git based installtions
- [ ] app store installations (if there is an api and on Mac OS)
- [ ] include `--resume-from` flag or flag to only run subscripts (which might rely on variables in `setup.sh`)
